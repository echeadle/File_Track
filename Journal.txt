Started Journal May 1 2023.

This journal will chronical my efforts to create a file tracking program.
    1. Gets the path, file name and hash of files on my computer.
    2. By using the hash I can find identical files.
    3. Keep track of changes to the file. (Maybe last date?)
    4. The input is either a file or directory.

 I have collected a number of different files that may be germain to the 
 effort that may or may not end up in the final version.
