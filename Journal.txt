Started Journal May 1 2023.

This journal will chronical my efforts to create a file tracking program.
    1. Gets the path, file name and hash of files on my computer.
    2. By using the hash I can find identical files.
    3. Keep track of changes to the file. (Maybe last date?)
    4. The input is either a file or directory.

 I have collected a number of different files that may be germain to the 
 effort that may or may not end up in the final version.

  I found the file listings that were made before and after I copied the files
  to the /HOS/learn/python-in-containers/Docs/ directory.  I don't remember
  if the files I found have the original locations of the pdf files.

  If not then the file locations may be found looking at the backups.

  Right now I will be looking for Database books to figure out how to 
  create the Database.  It will have Filename, filepath, and hash.
  I want to be able to find all files that have the same hash. 
  
  The files that have the locations and filename of the old system
  is /home/echeadle/Workspace/AI_Prog/File_Track/documents.
